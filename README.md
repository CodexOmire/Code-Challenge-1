→ Description:

The files in this project are solutions to the Week 1 JavaScript code challenge. There are three challenges in total:

• chaiCalculator  
• bodaFareCalculator  
• mobileMoneyEstimator  

Each challenge is written in JavaScript and runs through a simple HTML file using the browser console. All code is well-commented and was tested to make sure it works correctly.

-----------------------

→ Project Setup Steps:

1. I started by setting up the GitHub repository and cloning it to my local machine.
2. I read through all the challenge instructions carefully to understand the requirements.
3. I wrote JavaScript code for each challenge in a separate folder.
4. I tested all code using browser prompts and console logs to confirm the results.
5. I also did desk-checking to make sure the calculations were accurate.

→ How to Use:

• Open any `index.html` file in a browser.  
• Open the console (Right-click → Inspect → Console).  
• You’ll be prompted to enter values — results will be printed in the console.
